# React Native Coding Exercise

This app was created using Expo along with some additional libraries:

- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: For persistent storage.
- **@react-navigation/native**: For navigation between screens.
- **nativewind**: For styling components using Tailwind CSS.
- **zustand**: For state management.

You can run this app using Expo Go without the need to create a build.

> Note: This app interacts directly with a simulated API/backend, fetching users and transactions from a database. Sending and requesting money updates wallet amounts and creates new transaction data. The API is hosted on a free instance on Render, which may cause delays of 50 seconds or more after periods of inactivity. Please be patient with the first request. ðŸš€
